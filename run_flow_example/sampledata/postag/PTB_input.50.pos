Rolls-Royce	Motor	Cars	Inc.	said	it	expects	its	U.S.	sales	to	remain	steady	at	about	1,200	cars	in	1990	.
The	luxury	auto	maker	last	year	sold	1,214	cars	in	the	U.S.
Howard	Mosher	,	president	and	chief	executive	officer	,	said	he	anticipates	growth	for	the	luxury	auto	maker	in	Britain	and	Europe	,	and	in	Far	Eastern	markets	.
BELL	INDUSTRIES	Inc.	increased	its	quarterly	to	10	cents	from	seven	cents	a	share	.

Investors	are	appealing	to	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	not	to	limit	their	access	to	information	about	stock	purchases	and	sales	by	corporate	insiders	.
A	SEC	proposal	to	ease	reporting	requirements	for	some	company	executives	would	undermine	the	usefulness	of	information	on	insider	trades	as	a	stock-picking	tool	,	individual	investors	and	professional	money	managers	contend	.
They	make	the	argument	in	letters	to	the	agency	about	rule	changes	proposed	this	past	summer	that	,	among	other	things	,	would	exempt	many	middle-management	executives	from	reporting	trades	in	their	own	companies	'	shares	.
The	proposed	changes	also	would	allow	executives	to	report	exercises	of	options	later	and	less	often	.
Many	of	the	letters	maintain	that	investor	confidence	has	been	so	shaken	by	the	1987	stock	market	crash	--	and	the	markets	already	so	stacked	against	the	little	guy	--	that	any	decrease	in	information	on	insider-trading	patterns	might	prompt	individuals	to	get	out	of	stocks	altogether	.
``	The	SEC	has	historically	paid	obeisance	to	the	ideal	of	a	level	playing	field	,	''	wrote	Clyde	S.	McGregor	of	Winnetka	,	Ill.	,	in	one	of	the	92	letters	the	agency	has	received	since	the	changes	were	proposed	Aug.	17	.
``	Apparently	the	commission	did	not	really	believe	in	this	ideal	.	''
Currently	,	the	rules	force	executives	,	directors	and	other	corporate	insiders	to	report	purchases	and	sales	of	their	companies	'	shares	within	about	a	month	after	the	transaction	.
But	about	25	%	of	the	insiders	,	according	to	SEC	figures	,	file	their	reports	late	.
The	changes	were	proposed	in	an	effort	to	streamline	federal	bureaucracy	and	boost	compliance	by	the	executives	``	who	are	really	calling	the	shots	,	''	said	Brian	Lane	,	special	counsel	at	the	SEC	's	office	of	disclosure	policy	,	which	proposed	the	changes	.
Investors	,	money	managers	and	corporate	officials	had	until	today	to	comment	on	the	proposals	,	and	the	issue	has	produced	more	mail	than	almost	any	other	issue	in	memory	,	Mr.	Lane	said	.
The	SEC	will	probably	vote	on	the	proposal	early	next	year	,	he	said	.
Not	all	those	who	wrote	oppose	the	changes	.
The	Committee	on	Federal	Regulation	of	Securities	for	the	American	Bar	Association	argues	,	for	example	,	in	its	lengthy	letter	to	the	SEC	,	that	the	proposed	changes	``	would	substantially	improve	the	-LCB-	law	-RCB-	by	conforming	it	more	closely	to	contemporary	business	realities	.	''
What	the	investors	who	oppose	the	proposed	changes	object	to	most	is	the	effect	they	say	the	proposal	would	have	on	their	ability	to	spot	telltale	``	clusters	''	of	trading	activity	--	buying	or	selling	by	more	than	one	officer	or	director	within	a	short	period	of	time	.
According	to	some	estimates	,	the	rule	changes	would	cut	insider	filings	by	more	than	a	third	.
The	SEC	's	Mr.	Lane	vehemently	disputed	those	estimates	.
The	rules	will	eliminate	filings	policy-making	divisions	,	such	as	sales	,	marketing	,	finance	and	research	and	development	,	Mr.	Lane	said	.
The	proposed	rules	also	would	be	tougher	on	the	insiders	still	required	to	file	reports	,	he	said	.
Companies	would	be	compelled	to	publish	in	annual	proxy	statements	the	names	of	insiders	who	fail	to	file	reports	on	time	.
Considered	as	a	whole	,	Mr.	Lane	said	,	the	filings	required	under	the	proposed	rules	``	will	be	at	least	as	effective	,	if	not	more	so	,	for	investors	following	transactions	.	''
But	Robert	Gabele	,	president	of	Invest/Net	,	a	North	Miami	,	Fla.	,	company	that	packages	and	sells	the	insider-trading	data	,	said	the	proposal	is	worded	so	vaguely	that	key	officials	may	fail	to	file	the	reports	.
Many	investors	wrote	asking	the	SEC	to	require	insiders	to	report	their	purchases	and	sales	immediately	,	not	a	month	later	.
But	Mr.	Lane	said	that	while	the	SEC	regulates	who	files	,	the	law	tells	them	when	to	do	so	.
Investors	who	want	to	change	the	required	timing	should	write	their	representatives	in	Congress	,	he	added	.
The	SEC	would	likely	be	amenable	to	legislation	that	required	insiders	to	file	transactions	on	a	more	timely	basis	,	he	said	.
The	nation	's	largest	pension	fund	,	which	oversees	$	80	billion	for	college	employees	,	plans	to	offer	two	new	investment	options	to	its	1.2	million	participants	.
The	Teachers	Insurance	and	Annuity	Association-College	Retirement	Equities	Fund	said	it	will	introduce	a	stock	and	bond	fund	that	will	invest	in	``	socially	responsible	''	companies	,	and	a	bond	fund	.
Both	funds	are	expected	to	begin	operation	around	March	1	,	subject	to	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	approval	.
For	its	employees	to	sign	up	for	the	options	,	a	college	also	must	approve	the	plan	.
Some	4,300	institutions	are	part	of	the	pension	fund	.
The	new	options	carry	out	part	of	an	agreement	that	the	pension	fund	,	under	pressure	to	relax	its	strict	participation	rules	and	to	provide	more	investment	options	,	reached	with	the	SEC	in	December	.
The	new	``	social	choice	''	fund	will	shun	securities	of	companies	linked	to	South	Africa	,	nuclear	power	and	in	some	cases	,	Northern	Ireland	.
Also	excluded	will	be	investments	in	companies	with	``	significant	''	business	stemming	from	weapons	manufacture	,	alcoholic	beverages	or	tobacco	.
Sixty	percent	of	the	fund	will	be	invested	in	stocks	,	with	the	rest	going	into	bonds	or	short-term	investments	.
The	bond	fund	will	invest	in	high-grade	or	medium-grade	bonds	,	mortgages	or	asset-backed	securities	,	including	as	much	as	15	%	in	foreign	securities	.
The	fund	also	might	buy	and	sell	futures	and	options	contracts	,	subject	to	approval	by	the	New	York	State	Insurance	Department	.
Under	two	new	features	,	participants	will	be	able	to	transfer	money	from	the	new	funds	to	other	investment	funds	or	,	if	their	jobs	are	terminated	,	receive	cash	from	the	funds	.
The	investment	choices	offered	by	the	pension	fund	currently	are	limited	to	a	stock	fund	,	an	annuity	and	a	money-market	fund	.
New	Brunswick	Scientific	Co.	,	a	maker	of	biotechnology	instrumentation	and	equipment	,	said	it	adopted	an	anti-takeover	plan	giving	shareholders	the	right	to	purchase	shares	at	half	price	under	certain	conditions	.
The	company	said	the	plan	,	under	review	for	some	time	,	will	protect	shareholders	against	``	abusive	takeover	tactics	.
